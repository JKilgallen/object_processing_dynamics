\def \articleABSTRACT{The recognition of object categories in the human brain has been investigated with electroencephalography (EEG) using classification-based Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). In the target study, several single-trial classification tasks were performed, and the resulting confusion matrices were used to derive representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs). The RDMs were subsequently used to analyze the representational structure of object categories, and the spatio-temporal dynamics of those representations. However, prior work has identified a confound affecting the evaluation methods employed by several EEG decoding studies, including the target study. Moreover, our review of the target study identified two additional issues: (i) principal components derived from the entire feature matrix were used to reduce dimensionality, enabling test set leakage, and (ii) the dissimilarity metric used to compute the RDMs is invalid, as it violates both non-negativity and unit self-similarity. Our replication study re-evaluates the results of the target study using under two distinct approaches. One which is consistent with the analyses described in the target study, and another which appropriately mitigates its methodological issues. We found that while the target study was computationally reproducible, it was not substantially reproducible as several of its findings are not supported by more robust analyses. More broadly, our study underscores that the replication of prior work is an undervalued, but important process as it not only establishes computational reproducibility, but renders methodological validity more transparent.
