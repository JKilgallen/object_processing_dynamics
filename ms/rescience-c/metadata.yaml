abstract: "The recognition of object categories in the human brain has been investigated with electroencephalography (EEG) using classification-based Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). In the target study, single-trial confusion matrices from a multi-class classifier were used to derive representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) and to examine the representational structure of object categories as well as the spatiotemporal dynamics of those representations. While prior work has identified a confound affecting the evaluation methods employed by the target study, the extent to which this issue affects the central claims of the target study remains unclear. Consequently, we attempted to reproduce the results of the target study by re-implementing the described analysis pipeline and applying it to the original dataset. However, during this process two additional issues which affect the results of the target study were identified. Firstly, the principal components used to reduce the dimensionality of the data were calculated using the entire feature matrix, and consequently features of the test set may have leaked to the training set. Secondly, the metric used to determine the dissimilarity of representations is invalid as it failes to satisfy both non-negativity, and the identity principle. As a result of these issues, while we followed the reported methodology in all other respects, we were unable to replicate the primary findings. Our findings highlight the importance of a standard robust methodology to both multi-class electroencephalography decoding, and classification based RSA."
